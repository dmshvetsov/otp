## Glossary

VAA - Verifiable Action Approval, a proof that the message has been signed by the majority of the guardians (validators) of wormhole

DOV â€“ DeFi options vault

Liquidity - efficiency or ease with which an asset or security can be converted into ready cash without affecting its market price

Liquidity (in crypto) - the ease or rapidity with which one can buy or sell a digital asset close to its market price

## Optimization ideas

- [x] do not mint option fungible token unit there is a buyer
- [ ] convert timestamp in the option name to date in format `08SEP2023`
- [ ] maybe it is better to use u128 for supply_amount for option tokens on creation
- [ ] freeze collaterized asset on the option issuer account instead of transfer it to resource account address
